# 🧠 NeuroVest (Beta)

**AI-Powered Economic Forecasting Platform**  
Predict market trends. Identify undervalued assets. Translate data into financial insight.

---

## 📘 Overview

**NeuroVest** is an advanced **economic forecasting and market analysis platform** that helps investors and analysts anticipate financial trends before they happen.

Built around a **machine learning forecasting engine**, NeuroVest analyzes both live and historical data to detect spikes, crashes, and valuation shifts using a combination of quantitative, sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators.

It bridges the gap between traditional financial modeling and intelligent automation, offering a data-driven lens for understanding the markets.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Forecasting Engine** - Predicts market regimes (spike, crash, neutral) using XGBoost and Random Forest models.
- **Signal Integration** – Merges macroeconomic indicators (FRED), sentiment data (Reddit + NewsAPI), and technical metrics (RSI, MACD, momentum).
- **Automated Backtesting** – Simulates performance, calculating Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and profit factor.
- **Parameter Sweeps** – Optimizes model thresholds for maximum profitability.
- **Comprehensive Logging** – Stores predictions, metrics, and thresholds for reproducibility.
- **Full Automation** – Run all stages (refresh, train, predict, evaluate) from a single script (`run_all.py`).
- **Modular Design** – Easily extendable for new models or data sources.
